## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Stacks Wallet**: [Hiro Wallet](https://wallet.hiro.so/) or compatible
- **Development Environment**: Node.js, Clarinet CLI
- **Basic Knowledge**: Understanding of Clarity smart contracts and zero-knowledge concepts

### Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install @stacks/transactions @stacks/network
```

2. **Connect to Contract**
```javascript
import { StacksNetwork } from '@stacks/network';
import { callReadOnlyFunction } from '@stacks/transactions';

// Check contract statistics
const result = await callReadOnlyFunction({
  contractAddress: 'SP...',
  contractName: 'zk-proof-system',
