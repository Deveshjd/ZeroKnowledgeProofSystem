# 🔐 Zero Knowledge Proof System

**General-purpose privacy infrastructure for building anonymous applications on Stacks blockchain**

## 📖 Project Description

The Zero Knowledge Proof System is a revolutionary privacy infrastructure built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. This system provides developers with the essential building blocks needed to create truly anonymous applications while maintaining the security and transparency benefits of blockchain technology.

Our platform offers two core privacy primitives:
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Verification**: Submit and verify cryptographic proofs without revealing underlying data
- **Anonymous Identity Management**: Create privacy-preserving identity commitments for anonymous interactions

### 🔑 Key Features

- **🛡️ Privacy-First**: Complete anonymity for user interactions
- **🔒 Cryptographically Secure**: Advanced ZK proof verification mechanisms
- **🚫 Double-Spend Protection**: Nullifier-based prevention of replay attacks
- **📊 Transparent Statistics**: On-chain tracking without compromising privacy
- **⚡ Developer-Friendly**: Simple integration with existing applications
- **🌐 Decentralized**: No reliance on centralized privacy authorities

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Stacks Wallet**: [Hiro Wallet](https://wallet.hiro.so/) or compatible
- **Development Environment**: Node.js, Clarinet CLI
- **Basic Knowledge**: Understanding of Clarity smart contracts and zero-knowledge concepts

### Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install @stacks/transactions @stacks/network
```

2. **Connect to Contract**
```javascript
import { StacksNetwork } from '@stacks/network';
import { callReadOnlyFunction } from '@stacks/transactions';

// Check contract statistics
const result = await callReadOnlyFunction({
  contractAddress: 'SP...',
  contractName: 'zk-proof-system',
  functionName: 'get-contract-stats',
  functionArgs: [],
  network: new StacksMainnet()
});
```

3. **Submit a ZK Proof**
```javascript
import { makeContractCall } from '@stacks/transactions';

const txOptions = {
  contractAddress: 'SP...',
  contractName: 'zk-proof-system',
  functionName: 'submit-zk-proof',
  functionArgs: [
    bufferFromHex(proofHash),
    bufferFromHex(nullifier),
    bufferFromHex(verificationData)
  ],
  network: new StacksMainnet()
};

const transaction = await makeContractCall(txOptions);
```
